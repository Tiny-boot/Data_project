# Data_project
The goal of this data project is to use different Machine learning, deep learning and a time series models to try and predict Influenza cases in California between 2008 to 2019.
# Datasets
We use different datasets freely available on the internet. The first one is Wikipedia data with the number of views per article related to Influenza. The second source is Google trend data that capture number of search queries for keywords. And finally weather data with different components.

# Method
For our models we use a Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ARX and LSTM.
